 This project is the development of a Smart Farming infrastructure based on IoT, Blockchain, GIS and Datas Science. This project will include the development of the IoT platform for monitoring sensors and control of the watering system (and the code for an Arduino PoC). Also it will include the development of a Blockchain Platform to keep track of the crops. The GIS platform will include the use of GPS signals to get more information and Drone Mapping. Finally the Data Science Platform will get information from IoT and GIS to generate datasets and apply different Machine Learning algorithms to predict outcomes and feed the other platforms with useful information. The conceptual development of this project can be found [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOYS4YvU=/).
